## Privacy Policy

Effective Date: May 18, 2025

Last Updated: May 18, 2025

Mysta Technologies, Inc. (“Mysta”) respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes our current data handling practices for the Mysta browser extension (the “Service”).

### 1. Information We Do Not Collect

Mysta is built for local-only execution. We do not:

- Collect or store any PII (name, email, IP address, etc.);
- Track your browsing history or session behavior;
- Access or retain cookies, form data, or autofill information;
- Implement any third-party trackers, pixels, or analytics libraries.

### 2. Local Execution Guarantee

- The Service does not transmit any data to Mysta-operated servers.
- All processing occurs on-device, within your browser environment.
- No data is logged, retained, or linked to Mysta infrastructure.

### 3. Optional Telemetry (Future-Proofing)

In the event Mysta introduces diagnostics:

- It will be opt-in only and require clear, informed consent;
- All telemetry will be anonymized or aggregated;
- The data collected will comply with CCPA, CPRA, and FTC standards.

### 4. Children’s Privacy

Mysta is not intended for users under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from minors, in compliance with COPPA.

### 5. U.S. State Law Compliance

Mysta’s zero-data design means most privacy statutes do not apply. However, should we introduce optional features:

- CCPA/CPRA rights (access, deletion, opt-out) will be honored;
- We will notify users before any material change in data practices.

### 6. Policy Changes

We reserve the right to update this Policy. Material changes will be disclosed via the Chrome Web Store or the extension interface.
